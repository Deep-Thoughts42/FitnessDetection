Since we only have one class for classification at the moment, it makes sense to use some kind
of autoencoder for this project. Given an input of our exercise images, we should be able to
train the autoencoder and use it for the purposes of anomaly detection. Based on a threshold 
we set for the expected loss between input and output, we can then determine if the input is 
depicting someone doing a jumping jack or not.
